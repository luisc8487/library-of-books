# Library Of Books

Welcome to **Library of Books**!  
This is a simple web application where you can keep track of books you want to read. You can add new books, update their titles, remove books, and see your reading list—all right in your browser.

## What Can You Do?

- **Delete a Book:** Click the "Delete" button to remove a book from your list.
- **View Books:** All your books are shown in a list, each with a title and a sample image.

## How Does It Work?

- When you add a book, it appears instantly in your list.
- If you edit a book's title, the list updates right away.
- If you delete a book, it disappears from the list.
- All changes happen on the page without needing to reload.

## What Does It Look Like?

Each book in your list looks like this:

- The image is a random picture from [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/).
